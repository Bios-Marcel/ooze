## Mutation Testing?

Mutation testing is a technique used to assess the quality and coverage of test suites. It involves introducing controlled changes to the code base, simulating common programming mistakes. These changes are, then, put to test against the test suites. A failing test suite is a good sign. It indicates that the tests are identifying mutations in the codeâ€”it "killed the mutant". If all tests pass, we have a surviving mutant. This highlights an area with weak coverage. It is an opportunity for improvement.

There are different types of changes that mutation tests can perform. A common collection usually include:

* Changing an operator;
* Replacing a constant;
* Removing a statement;
* Increasing/decreasing numbers;
* Flipping booleans;

Mutations can also be domain/application-specific. Although, these are up to the maintainers of such application to develop.

It is worth mentioning that mutation tests can be quite expensive to run. Especially on larger code bases. And the reason is that for every mutation, on every source file, the entire suite of tests has to run. One can look at the bright side of this and think as an incentive to keep the test suites fast.

Mutation testing is a great ally in developing a robust code base and a reliable set of test suites.

## Quick Start

1. Install ooze:

	```shell
	go get github.com/gtramontina/ooze
	```

2. Create a `mutation_test.go` file in the root of your repository and add the following:

	```go
	//go:build mutation

	package main_test

	import (
		"testing"

		"github.com/gtramontina/ooze"
	)

	func TestMutation(t *testing.T) {
		ooze.Release(t)
	}
	```

3. Run with:

	```shell
	go test -v -tags=mutation
	```

## Settings

Ooze's [`Release`](release.go) method takes variadic [`Options`](options.go), like so:

```go
ooze.Release(
	t,
	ooze.WithRepositoryRoot("."),
	ooze.WithTestCommand("make test"),
	ooze.WithMinimumThreshold(0.75),
	ooze.Parallel(),
	ooze.IgnoreSourceFiles("^release\\.go$"),
)
```

The table below presents all available options.

| Option                 | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WithRepositoryRoot`   | `.`                       | A string that configures which directory is the repository root. This is usually required when your mutation test file lives some other place that is not root itself.                                                                                                     |
| `WithTestCommand`      | `go test -count=1 ./...`  | The test command to run, as string. You may configure it as you wish, as a `makefile` phony target, for example. Or simply run the standard `go test` command with extra flags, such as `timeout` and `tags`.                                                              |
| `WithMinimumThreshold` | `1.0`                     | A float between `0.0` and `1.0`. This represents the minimum mutation test score to consider the execution successful.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Parallel`             | `false`                   | Indicates whether to run the tests on the mutants in parallel. Given Ooze is executed via Go's testing framework, the level of parallelism can be configured when running the mutation tests. For example with `WithTestCommand("go test -v -tags=mutation -parallel 3")`. |
| `IgnoreSourceFiles`    | `nil`                     | Regular expression representing source files to be filtered out and not suffer any mutations.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `WithViruses`          | all available (see below) | A list of viruses to infect the source files with. You can also implement your own viruses (generic or even application-specific).                                                                                                                                         |
