## Mutation Testing?

Mutation testing is a technique used to assess the quality and coverage of test suites. It involves introducing controlled changes to the code base, simulating common programming mistakes. These changes are, then, put to test against the test suites. A failing test suite is a good sign. It indicates that the tests are identifying mutations in the codeâ€”it "killed the mutant". If all tests pass, we have a surviving mutant. This highlights an area with weak coverage. It is an opportunity for improvement.

There are different types of changes that mutation tests can perform. A common collection usually include:

* Changing an operator;
* Replacing a constant;
* Removing a statement;
* Increasing/decreasing numbers;
* Flipping booleans;

Mutations can also be domain/application-specific. Although, these are up to the maintainers of such application to develop.

It is worth mentioning that mutation tests can be quite expensive to run. Especially on larger code bases. And the reason is that for every mutation, on every source file, the entire suite of tests has to run. One can look at the bright side of this and think as an incentive to keep the test suites fast.

Mutation testing is a great ally in developing a robust code base and a reliable set of test suites.

## Quick Start

1. Install ooze:

	```shell
	go get github.com/gtramontina/ooze
	```

	This pulls the latest version of Ooze and updates your `go.mod` and `go.sum` to reference this new dependency.

2. Create a `mutation_test.go` file in the root of your repository and add the following:

	```go
	//go:build mutation

	package main_test

	import (
		"testing"

		"github.com/gtramontina/ooze"
	)

	func TestMutation(t *testing.T) {
		ooze.Release(t)
	}
	```

	The build tag is so you can better control _when_ to run these tests (see the next step). This is a test as you'd write any other Go test. What differs is what the test actually does. And this is where it delegates to Ooze, by `Release`ing it.

3. Run with:

	```shell
	go test -v -tags=mutation
	```

	This will execute all tests in the current package including the sources tagged with `mutation`. This assumes that the above is the only test file in the root of your project. If you have other tests, you may want to put the mutation tests in a separate package, under `./mutation` for example, and configure Ooze to use `..` as the repository root (see [`WithRepositoryRoot`](#Settings) below).

	The `-v` flag is optional. It is used to print the progress of the tests as they run. If you don't want to see this, you can remove it.

	> **Note**
	> printing to `stdout` while Go tests are running has its intricacies. Running the tests at a particular package (without specifying which test file or subpackages, like `./...`), allows for Ooze to print progress and reports as they happen. Otherwise, the output is buffered and printed at the end of the test run and, in some cases, only if a test fails. This is a limitation of Go's testing framework.

## Settings

Ooze's [`Release`](release.go) method takes variadic [`Options`](options.go), like so:

```go
ooze.Release(
	t,
	ooze.WithRepositoryRoot("."),
	ooze.WithTestCommand("make test"),
	ooze.WithMinimumThreshold(0.75),
	ooze.Parallel(),
	ooze.IgnoreSourceFiles("^release\\.go$"),
)
```

The table below presents all available options.

| Option                 | Default                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WithRepositoryRoot`   | `.`                                   | A string that configures which directory is the repository root. This is usually required when your mutation test file lives some other place that is not root itself.                                                                                                        |
| `WithTestCommand`      | `go test -count=1 ./...`              | The test command to run, as string. You may configure it as you wish, as a `makefile` phony target, for example. Or simply run the standard `go test` command with extra flags, such as `timeout` and `tags`.                                                                 |
| `WithMinimumThreshold` | `1.0`                                 | A float between `0.0` and `1.0`. This represents the minimum mutation test score to consider the execution successful.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Parallel`             | `false`                               | Indicates whether to run the tests on the mutants in parallel. Given Ooze is executed via Go's testing framework, the level of parallelism can be configured when running the mutation tests from the command line. For example with `go test -v -tags=mutation -parallel 3`. |
| `IgnoreSourceFiles`    | `nil`                                 | Regular expression representing source files to be filtered out and not suffer any mutations.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `WithViruses`          | all available ([see below](#Viruses)) | A list of viruses to infect the source files with. You can also implement your own viruses (generic or even application-specific).                                                                                                                                            |

### Custom viruses

Ooze's viruses to follow the [`viruses.Virus`](viruses/virus.go) interface. All it takes to write a new virus is to have a struct that implements this interface. To get this new virus running, let Ooze know about it by running `Release` with the `WithViruses(â€¦)` option. In order to test it, you may want to use the [oozetesting](oozetesting) package to help out. Take a look at the existing [viruses](viruses) to have an idea.

If your new virus is domain-agnostic, and you find it useful, consider contributing it to this project. You can also write domain-specific viruses. One that look for a particular struct type and change it in a particular way, for example.

## Prior Art

Ooze is heavily inspired by [go-mutesting](https://github.com/zimmski/go-mutesting), by [@zimmski](https://github.com/zimmski), and by extra mutations added to a [fork](https://github.com/avito-tech/go-mutesting) by [@avito-tech](https://github.com/avito-tech).

You can find more resources and tools on this subject by browsing through the [mutation testing](https://github.com/topics/mutation-testing) topic on GitHub. The [awesome-mutation-testing](https://github.com/theofidry/awesome-mutation-testing) repository also contains many good resources.
